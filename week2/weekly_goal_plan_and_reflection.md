## Week 2

### Misson for the week

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
* You may notice you are completing the work quicker and with more ease than your peers. If this sounds like you, it's important to speak to a coach as they can provide additional challenge for you to make sure you continue to progress.

Start attending process workshops to focus on your developer process. Anyone from any cohort ever can attend.

## Week 2

#### SMART Goals 

##### Goal 1
 **Specific** : To understand the concept of mocking <br>
 **Measurable** : Completion of all the challenges with my paring partners <br>
 **Actionable** : The training and learning material provided I will be able to achieve this goal <br>
 **Relevant** : This goal is directly linked to course and week 2 goal <br>
 **Timely** : Will be completed by friday COP ( 01/04/22) <br>

##### Goal 2
 **Specific** : To learn more basic object oriented principles and tie them to high level concerns <br>
 **Measurable** : I will make sure that I am reading the technical modules and implementing than in daily challenge  <br>
 **Actionable** : I will share my understanding with my pairing partner and ask for their feedback <br>
 **Relevant** : This goal is directly linked to course and week 2 goal. Will help me be more confident in OOO programming <br>
 **Timely** : WIll be completed by friday COP (01/02/22) <br>

##### Goal 3
 **Specific** : I will look after my wellbeing <br>
 **Measurable** : I will atleast log 1 hours of walking or rowing or yoga or other kinds of excersie in a day <br>
 **Actionable** : It is actionable and will help me with time managment <br>
 **Relevant** : This is relevant to the ethos of Makers and good for my health <br>
 **Timely** : This is a continous goal <br>

#### Tuesday plan 

* [Tracking learning] (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/self_directed_learning/resources/tracking_your_learning.md)
* [Encapsulation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29)
* [Encapsulation](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/oop_1)
* [Encapsulation & Cohesion](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md)
* [Debbuging excercise] https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/debugging_fizzbuzz

#### Reflection at the end of the week
* **For goal 1** I attended the workshop on doubles, mocking and stubs. That really helped me to build up the theoratical aspect of it. I independently completed two excercises on these concepts. Overall result of this was that I was able to do stubing for weekend challege withour any issue.  
* **For goal 2** I feel more confident in OOO. I understand SOLID principle. I have started using dependency injections, domain modelling and planning the code better before typing anything in. I spent 2 hours on planning code for weekend challenge and did some concept testing( using small codes). This helped me to complete the weekend challenge by saturday COP. 
* **For goal 3** I am felling better about giving time to my wellbeing. I plan my day better to include time boxed excercises.

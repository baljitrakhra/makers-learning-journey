## Week 1

### Goals (Misson for the week)

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

#### Wider course goals this week should help with (see all [course goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/course_goals.md))

<dl>
  <dt>I can TDD anything</dt>
  <dd>By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.</dd>
  <dt>I can program fluently</dt>
  <dd>You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.</dd>
  <dt>I can debug anything</dt>
  <dd>You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.</dd>

## Week 1

#### SMART Goals 

##### Goal 1
 **Specific** : To use TDD and debugging methodology for solving all the 22 challenges of Boris bike problem <br>
 **Measurable** : Completion of all the challenges with my paring partners <br>
 **Actionable** : The training and learning material provided I will be able to achieve this goal <br>
 **Relevant** : This goal is directly linked to course and week 1 goal <br>
 **Timely** : Will be completed by friday COP ( 25/03/22) <br>

##### Goal 2
 **Specific** : To learn some basic object oriented principles like encapsulation, SRP etc <br>
 **Measurable** : Completion of all the OOO lessons and excercises on codeacadmey ruby couse <br>
 **Actionable** : I have done this in January and will be able to redo it <br>
 **Relevant** : This goal is directly linked to course and week 1 goal. Will help me be more confident in OOO programming <br>
 **Timely** : WIll be completed by tuesday COP (22/03/22) <br>



#### Tuesday plan 

* [Tracking learning] (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/goals/self_directed_learning/resources/tracking_your_learning.md)
* [Encapsulation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29)
* [Encapsulation](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/oop_1)
* [Encapsulation & Cohesion](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md)
* [Debbuging excercise] https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/debugging_fizzbuzz

#### Reflection at the end of the week
* **For goal 1** I was able to finish 20 challenges and it was really helpfull in understanding the concepts. 
* **For goal 2** I revised all the code academy lessons for OOO and also read Maker's material on OOO. I feel more confident in my undestanding of OOO and related concepts
